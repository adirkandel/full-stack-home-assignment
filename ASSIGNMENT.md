# Full Stack Home Assignment

## Welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to work on this assignment. This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your full-stack development skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.

## Application Overview

You're working with a Task Management application that allows users to:

- Register and authenticate
- Create and manage tasks
- Add comments to tasks
- Assign tasks to team members

The application is built with:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma

## Your Tasks

### 1. Improve the Codebase

The codebase is functional but has room for improvement. Your task is to:

- Review the code and identify areas that need improvement
- Fix any bugs or issues you discover
- Refactor code for better maintainability, performance, and security
- Improve type safety and error handling
- Enhance the user experience

**Note**: We're looking for your ability to identify problems, not just fix what we tell you to fix. Take your time to explore the codebase thoroughly.

### 2. Add New Features

Choose **1-2 features** from the following list to implement:

#### Option A: Real-time Collaboration

Implement real-time updates using WebSockets. When one user updates a task, other users viewing the same task should see the changes immediately.

#### Option B: Advanced Filtering & Search

Enhance the task filtering system with:

- Multi-criteria filtering (status, priority)
- Full-text search across task titles and descriptions
- Saved filter presets
- URL-based filter state (shareable links)

#### Option C: Task Dependencies & Subtasks

Add the ability to:

- Create subtasks for a parent task
- Define task dependencies (Task A must be completed before Task B)
- Visualize task dependencies in a graph or tree view
- Prevent circular dependencies

#### Option D: Activity Feed / Audit Log

Implement an activity feed that tracks:

- Task creation, updates, and deletions
- Comment additions
- Assignment changes
- User actions with timestamps
- Filterable by user, task, or date range

#### Option E: File Attachments

Add file upload functionality:

- Upload files to tasks
- Support multiple file types
- File preview/download
- File size limits and validation

#### Option F: Task Templates

Create a template system:

- Save tasks as templates
- Create tasks from templates
- Template library with categories
- Bulk create tasks from templates

### 3. Creative Feature

In addition to the features above, implement **one feature of your own design**. This is your chance to be creative and show what you think would make this application better. Consider:

- What would improve the user experience?
- What would make the application more useful?
- What would demonstrate your technical skills?

Some ideas (but feel free to come up with your own):

- Analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
- Task scheduling and calendar view
- Export/import functionality (CSV, JSON)
- Bulk operations (bulk edit, bulk delete, bulk assign)
- Custom fields and metadata
- Task time tracking
- Integration with external APIs
- Mobile-responsive improvements
- Dark mode
- Keyboard shortcuts

## Technical Requirements

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use proper error handling
- Add appropriate comments where needed
- Follow consistent code style

### Frontend

- Use React best practices (hooks, component composition)
- Implement proper state management
- Handle loading and error states
- Ensure responsive design
- Consider accessibility (WCAG basics)

### Backend

- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Add input validation
- Ensure secure authentication and authorization
- Optimize database queries

### Database

- Design efficient database queries
- Consider performance implications
- Use proper relationships and constraints

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Clone** the repository to your github account and share it
2. **Complete** the tasks above
3. **Document** your changes:

   - Update this README with any setup changes if needed
   - Add comments explaining complex logic or design decisions
   - Optional - Create a `CHANGES.md` file listing:
     - Issues you identified and fixed
     - New features you implemented
     - Any architectural decisions you made
     - Known limitations or future improvements

4. **Test** your implementation:

   - Ensure the application runs without errors
   - Test the features you've added
   - Verify that existing functionality still works

5. **Submit**:
   - Push your code to a repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
   - Share the repository link
   - Include any additional setup instructions if needed

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll evaluate your submission based on:

### Code Quality

- Clean, readable code
- Proper TypeScript usage
- Error handling
- Code organization and structure

### Problem-Solving

- Ability to identify and fix issues
- Approach to solving problems
- Performance optimizations
- Security considerations

### Feature Implementation

- Quality of new features
- User experience
- Technical implementation
- Edge case handling

### Creativity

- Originality of your creative feature
- Innovation in approach
- User experience improvements

## Time Estimate

We expect this assignment to take approximately **4-6 hours**. Please don't spend more than 10 hours on it. If you run out of time, prioritize:

1. Fixing critical issues
2. Implementing at least 1 new feature
3. Documenting your work
